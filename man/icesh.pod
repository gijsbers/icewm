=head1 NAME

 icesh - control window properties and the IceWM window manager

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over

=item B<icesh> I<OPTIONS|ACTIONS>+

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<icesh> provides 85 commands to change or query a window's state,
and to interact with the L<icewm(1)> window manager. Command arguments
are called actions. Window actions operate on a selection of windows.
B<icesh> has several options to select and filter windows.  Options and
actions can be interspersed. They are processed and evaluated one after
another from left to right. Therefore, an option can only affect a
subsequent action, but not a previous one. Because of this, an action
can operate on a different selection of windows than a previous action,
if it is preceded by a new select option. In combination with filter
options, this gives B<icesh> its expressive power. Use it in
L<icewm-keys(5)> to define your own window management hotkeys.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<icesh> recognizes the following options:

=head2 SELECT OPTIONS

Select options specify the window or windows to which subsequent
actions apply. If none is given, but an action does require a window,
then a selection crossbar is invoked to select the desired window
interactively. The manager actions do not require window options.

The following five options I<select> one or more client windows.
If needed, they can be repeated for successive actions.

=over

=item B<-w>, B<-window> I<WINDOW_ID>

Specifies the identifier of the window, I<WINDOW_ID>, for which the
action applies.  Special identifiers are B<root> for the root window
and B<focus> for the currently focused window.

=item B<-r>, B<-root>

Is equivalent to B<-window> B<root> and selects the root window.

=item B<-f>, B<-focus>

Is equivalent to B<-window> B<focus> and selects the focused window.

=item B<-a>, B<-all>

Selects all clients of the window manager.

=item B<-s>, B<-shown>

Selects all currently visible clients of the window manager.

=item B<-t>, B<-top>

Selects all toplevel windows from the display unconditionally.

=back

=head2 FILTER OPTIONS

The following options I<filter> the currently selected set of windows.
If no previous I<select> option was given then a B<-all> option is
implicitly assumed to filter all client windows.

=over

=item B<-c>, B<-class> I<WM_CLASS>

Filters the set of windows on window manager class, I<WM_CLASS>.  If
I<WM_CLASS> contains a period, only windows with exactly the same
I<WM_CLASS> property are matched.  If there is no period, windows of the
same class and windows of the same instance (aka. I<-name>) are selected.

=item B<-l>, B<-last>

Filter clients and keep only the most recent client.

=item B<-m>, B<-machine> I<HOST>

Filters clients by host name. Clients with a WM_CLIENT_MACHINE property
equal to I<HOST> are selected.

=item B<-n>, B<-name> I<NAME>

Filters clients by _NET_WM_NAME or WM_NAME.
I<NAME> matches any part of the property value.
To match at the beginning use a C<^> prefix.
To match at the end use a C<$> suffix.

=item B<-p>, B<-pid> I<PID>

Filters clients by process ID. Clients with a _NET_WM_PID property equal
to I<PID> are selected.

=item B<-G>, B<-Gravity> I<GRAVITY>

Filters clients by the window gravity field of the WM_NORMAL_HINTS
property.  Clients with a gravity equal to I<GRAVITY> are selected.
If I<GRAVITY> starts with an exclamation mark then the filtering is
inverted.

=item B<-L>, B<-Layer> I<LAYER>

Filters clients by I<GNOME window layer>, which can either be a layer
name (see below) or a layer number.  If I<LAYER> starts with an
exclamation mark then the filtering is inverted.

=item B<-P>, B<-Property> I<PROP>

Filters clients by property. Clients which have a property I<PROP> are
selected.  The filtering is inverted if I<PROP> starts with an
exclamation mark.

=item B<-R>, B<-Role> I<ROLE>

Filters clients by WM_WINDOW_ROLE. Clients which have a WM_WINDOW_ROLE
property value equal to I<ROLE> are selected.  The filtering is inverted
if I<ROLE> starts with an exclamation mark.

=item B<-S>, B<-State> I<STATE>

Filters clients by I<GNOME window state>. Clients which have at least
a state of I<STATE> are selected.  The window state refers to details
like B<minized> or B<maximized> and is explained below.  If I<STATE>
starts with an exclamation mark then the filtering is inverted.
A question mark C<?> filters clients with any bit set in I<STATE>.

=item B<-W>, B<-Workspace> I<WORKSPACE>

Filter clients by workspace. Workspace I<WORKSPACE> is either a
workspace name or a workspace number counting from zero.
If I<WORKSPACE> starts with an exclamation mark then the filtering is
inverted.

=item B<-X>, B<-Xinerama> I<MONITOR>

Limit clients by I<RandR>/I<Xinerama> monitor. Only operate on
clients which are displayed on I<MONITOR>, where I<MONITOR> can
be C<All> for all monitors, C<this> for the monitor where the
active window is displayed, or a monitor number starting from zero.
See the output of C<randr> or C<xinerama> below.

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

The following options are identical for every IceWM command.

=over

=item B<-d>, B<-display> I<DISPLAY>

Specifies the X11 DISPLAY.  If unspecified, defaults to B<$DISPLAY>.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print a brief usage statement to F<stdout> and exit.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Print the program version to F<stdout> and exit.

=item B<-C>, B<--copying>

Print copying permissions to F<stdout> for the program and exit.

=back

=head1 ACTIONS

B<icesh> expects one or more action arguments.  There are two kinds of
actions: I<window actions> and I<manager actions>. The first operates on
the selected windows. The second directly interacts with the B<icewm>
window manager.
